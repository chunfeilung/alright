In GitHub repositories with paid plans, you can set up autolinks to external
resources like JIRA and Zendesk. However, these autolinks do not function in
pull request titles, where they are often most needed.

Alright (AutoLink References In GitHub Titles) is a free open-source browser
extension that allows you to add autolinks to pull request titles in all your
repositories via a familiar user interface, even without a paid plan.

This browser extension is independently developed and not officially endorsed by
